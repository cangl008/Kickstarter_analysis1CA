## Overview of ProjectLousie wants to know how successful her other theater, specifically plays, did in relation to time of the year and the percentage of successful, failed and canceled campaigns.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date pulling information from the kickstarter I created a line graph that clearly shows that the most successful months of compaigns were during teh sprin/summer months. During thise months the outcomes were more likely to be successful with less failed campaigns then during the winter months. The most successful month being May with 111 successful theater campaigns that either reached their goal or exceeded. While December was the least successful campaign month with only 37 successful theater campagins and 35 failed ones.
